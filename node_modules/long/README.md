=======

A Long class for representing a 64 bit two's-complement integer value derived from the [Closure Library](https://github.com/google/closure-library)
for stand-alone use and extended with unsigned support.

Background
----------

As of [ECMA-262 5th Edition](http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_8.5), "all the positive and negative integers
whose magnitude is no greater than 2<sup>53</sup> are representable in the Number type", which is "representing the
doubleprecision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values as specified in the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic".
The [maximum safe integer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
in JavaScript is 2<sup>53</sup>-1.

Example: 2<sup>64</sup>-1 is 1844674407370955**1615** but in JavaScript it evaluates to 1844674407370955**2000**.

Furthermore, bitwise o
